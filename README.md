To access each Earn product, you’ll first need to enter the Earn section. 

## Staking
Some cryptocurrencies use what’s known as a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Validators will stake a network’s native assets, receiving rewards for processing transactions honestly and being punished if they attempt to validate transactions that do not comply with network rules. 

The process of staking independently is quite involved and not recommended for novice users. OKX’s staking products take care of the technical details on your behalf, greatly simplifying the process. In a few clicks, you can contribute your assets to help support your favorite proof-of-stake networks. 

In the Staking section, scroll down to see which assets OKX supports. You’ll also see term lengths — i.e., the period during which your assets will be staked — and an estimated APY. After a term’s expiry, your staked position will automatically become a flexible one, enabling you to withdraw it at your leisure or continue generating rewards. 

Scroll down to find the asset you want to stake with OKX and click Subscribe to get started. 

On the next screen, you’ll see the staking options. Enter the amount of the asset you want to stake, check the details and click Subscribe to start staking. 

Next, read the “Staking user agreement” and check the box to indicate that you agree to the terms. Then, click Continue.

You can check on your staked positions in the “My earnings” section. From here, you can also withdraw staked assets by clicking on a position and clicking Redeem on the following pop-ups.
